# Figma Chat Web-Client

This package includes the Figma Chat web client. You can find the main instance here https://figma-chat.vercel.app/.

## But Why?

Quite simple. People who don't have rights to edit your Figma file can't run plugins.

## How to use?

Open the plugin inside your file and go to settings. Send https://figma-chat.vercel.app/ to the person you want to chat with and copy the "Auth-String" for them. This serves as a password, so don't give it to anyone else.
**Only people can enter a room if at least one person in the figma file is online.**
